```Explain what these do and how they fit together

1.   this.parts = [{ x, y }]
2.   const head = this.parts[0]
3.     this.parts.unshift({ x: newX, y: newY });
4.    this.parts.pop();
```


These code snippets are part of the `Snake` class and they define how the snake moves and grows in the game. Here's how they fit together:

1. `this.parts = [{ x, y }]` initializes the snake's body with a single part at the specified x and y coordinates. `x` and `y` are variables that hold the initial position of the snake's head.

2. `const head = this.parts[0]` gets a reference to the first part of the snake's body, which is the head. This is used later to update the position of the head.

3. `this.parts.unshift({ x: newX, y: newY })` adds a new part to the front of the snake's body, representing the new position of the head. `newX` and `newY` are the new x and y coordinates of the head. This is done by using the `unshift` method, which adds the new part to the beginning of the `parts` array.

4. `this.parts.pop()` removes the last part of the snake's body, representing the tail. This is done using the `pop` method, which removes the last element of the `parts` array. This ensures that the snake's body remains the same length, so it appears to be moving forward. 

In summary, these code snippets define how the `Snake` class moves and grows in the game. The `parts` property is an array of objects representing each part of the snake's body, and the `head` variable is a reference to the first part of the body. The `unshift` method is used to add a new part to the front of the body, representing the new position of the head, and the `pop` method is used to remove the last part of the body, representing the tail.
