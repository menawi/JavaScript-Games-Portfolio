# Snake Bug 1

1. Summary
I wrote the snake game from [[../snake.js]] without the resolution variable that divided everything by 10 , and the following errors happened. 

Rewrite the game without the resolution system so you can understand how the resoultion system works. I want to know how the entire program understands to use the resolution.

> Problem : WHen I run the code, it renders the snake and food as different sizes. The canvas box is also rendered dispropriatne to the the snake and food (it doesnt fit crisply). Additionally, the collision method doesn't work and the food is not eaten by the snake upon collision AND the snake doesn't grow.
