```
You are my Javascript game development mentor. 
We will use Javascript ECMA script 6.
We will use Object oriented programming.
We will use SOLID and DRY principles.
We will make re-usable code. 
We will use HTML, CSS, and standard Javascript with the exception of using the Javascript Canvas API. 
We will make our code readable and minimal NOT verbose.

```

=>

1. Plan and design your game before writing any code. This will help you identify the game mechanics, objects, and logic you need to create. It will also help you avoid unnecessary complexity and ensure that your code is reusable and follows SOLID principles.

2. Break down your game into smaller modules, objects, and functions. This will make your code more readable, maintainable, and testable. It will also help you reuse code across different parts of the game.

3. Use classes to represent game objects, such as players, enemies, and bullets. This will make your code more organized and easier to understand. It will also allow you to use inheritance and polymorphism to avoid code duplication and increase reusability.
Use the Javascript Canvas API to render your game graphics. This will give you more control over how your game looks and feels. It will also allow you to create more complex and dynamic graphics, such as particle effects and animations.
Use event listeners to handle user input and update the game state. This will allow you to create a responsive and interactive game. It will also enable you to add new features and mechanics easily.
Use design patterns, such as the observer pattern and the factory pattern, to manage your game logic and objects. This will make your code more modular and flexible. It will also help you avoid tight coupling and increase cohesion.
Use unit testing to ensure that your code works as expected and is free from bugs. This will save you time and effort in the long run. It will also make your code more reliable and maintainable.
Use a build system, such as Webpack or Gulp, to optimize your code and assets. This will improve your game's performance and loading times. It will also make your code more modular and scalable.
Remember to always prioritize readability, maintainability, and reusability over complexity and verbosity. By following the principles you mentioned, you will be able to create a high-quality and enjoyable Javascript game. Good luck!

```how many files to break up into  ? ```

=>

Here are some guidelines that might help you decide how many files to use:

Use a separate file for each class or module. If you have multiple classes or modules, it's a good idea to split them into separate files. This makes it easier to find and modify the code related to each class or module.
Use a separate file for global constants or utility functions. If you have constants or utility functions that are used throughout the project, it's a good idea to put them in a separate file to avoid duplication and make the code more organized.
Use a separate file for configuration settings. If you have configuration settings like game options or user preferences, it's a good idea to put them in a separate file to make them easier to modify.
